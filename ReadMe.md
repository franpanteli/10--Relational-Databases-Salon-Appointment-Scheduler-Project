# Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my tenth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler-project/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my SQL and shell scripting skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/10--Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the tenth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Creating the Project Shell and SQL Files
### Problem Solving
For this project, I had to write a Bash script which took appointments and services desired for customers at a hairdressers and stored them in an SQL database. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/10--Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). 

### Solution Workflow 
- To solve this problem, I first cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment. I used the CodeRoad VSCode extension to run tests on the working project files and to view their success criteria
- I exported these [success criteria from the project Gitpod environment as a PDF and annotated them in-depth with my problem solving thought processes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf)
- This required the creation of two files. The first was the project [`salon.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/salon.sh) file and the second was its [`salon.sql`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/salon.sql) file
- Further information about the functionality of these files is found in their project [notes file](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf). This allowed me to succesfully
