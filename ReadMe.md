# Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my tenth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler-project/build-a-salon-appointment-scheduler) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my SQL and shell scripting skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/10--Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the tenth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Creating the Project Shell and SQL Files
### Problem Solving
For this project, I had to write a Bash script which took appointments for customers at a hairdressers and stored them in an SQL database. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/10--Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). 

### Solution Workflow 
- To solve this problem, I first cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment. This user interface allowed me to run tests on the created project files and view the criteria that they had to satisfty to pass the project
- The [project criteria were exported from its Gitpod environment as a PDF and annotated in depth](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/Task%20Challenge%20Notes.pdf)
- The [in-depth notes I produced when completing this task are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/10--Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-salon-appointment-scheduler-project-course-notes.txt)
- This required the creation of two files, the first was the 
- INSERT_WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION

- INSERT [`INSERT_FILE_LINKS`](INSERT)
- I created in-depth notes for this [which are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/10--Relational-Databases-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-salon-appointment-scheduler-project-course-notes.txt)
